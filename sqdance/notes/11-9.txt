g6:
after n rounds, every pair of dancers will dance with each other. find soulmates after n rounds. no particular geometric structure to positioning of dancers

g8: same but uses a moebius strip embedded as two concentric circles to rotate dancers

g4, g2: wait full 2 minutes before swapping dancers

g9: uses local heuristics to move individual dancers

g5: two parallel lines

g3: starts with "snake" and then switches to default player

-d 1000

g6: lost a lot of points because of collisions while looking for soulmates

next deliverable:
fix initialization issues
take into account number of friends
take into high density situations
